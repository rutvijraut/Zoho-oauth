# Zoho-oauth

There are three routes in index.js file where the server is made.
I have made an Authorisation request on Zoho first, then I have generated the access token and the access token is helpful in getting the user details.
I have erased my client_id and client_secret for safety reasons one can input their client id and secret in this code in the .env file and run the code.
